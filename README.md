# eBFI-10

This is a link to an online version of the BFI-10 I've decided to call "eBFI-10": https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tbUk2ur6Mtb2bImFvWIvEb40d5wF0aLph1WWi0hozb4/edit?usp=sharing

I have also uploaded a file containing an SPSS syntax for the BFI-10. In this file, bfi10.1 represent the first item, bfi10.2 the second etc.
