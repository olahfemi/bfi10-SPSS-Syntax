# eBFI-10

This is simply a Google Forms version of the BFI-10. It can be accessed [here][1].

Please, don't modify the original form. Of course, you shouldn't dispense the original form either - you should copy the form.

I also recommend that you copy the Google sheet attached to the original form and attach it to your copy: it contains variable names in the accompanying SPSS Syntax (found in this repo, named "eBFI-10 SPSS Syntax"), and this should help make your work easier.

Also, because it was difficult for me to get a good copy of the original BFI-10 for my research, I've added one here.
